Navigating through all these requirements is challenging for health care experts, let alone inexperienced patients.\n\n## Patient Burden\n\nAs a result of these added layers of complexity, it can be difficult for patients to access and remain adherent to their prescribed specialty therapies. In fact, research shows that specialty medications are more likely to be abandoned relative to traditional pharmaceuticals, with 27 percent of patients failing to start therapy in some cases– despite it being prescribed by their doctor and approved by their insurance.[ref](# \"Medicine Use and Spending in the U.S., A Review of 2016 and Outlook to 2022, IQVIA Institute, 2017\")\n\nFor patients in the neurology therapeutic area, access challenges can contribute to medications adherence rates as low as 41 percent in some instances.[ref](# \"Narrative Review of the Literature on Adherence to Disease-Modifying Therapies Among Patients with Multiple Sclerosis, 2013\") Without expert support, neurology patients can find themselves coordinating all steps required to start therapy on their own -- with many describing this as a full-time job.[ref](# \"The Impact of Disease-Modifying Therapy Access Barriers on People with Multiple Sclerosis: Mixed-Methods Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018\") A 10-member patient advisory board for a specific neurological condition confirmed that patients feel significant burden from the process required to start specialty medications.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds Multiple Sclerosis Patient Advisory Board, 2019\") On average, these patients claimed to have made 30 or more phone calls to health care stakeholders and spent many hours personally coordinating their own care.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds Multiple Sclerosis Patient Advisory Board, 2019\")\n\n## Provider Burden\n\nAccess challenges for specialty medications extend to providers as well. In a recent survey to over 500 health care providers, fewer than one-third expressed satisfaction with the prescribing process for specialty medications – citing multiple hours each week spent on completing documentation for patients to start therapy, confusion about where to send specialty prescriptions and uncertainty about which enrollment documents to complete.[ref](# \"Help for the Patient Journey – Electronic Modernization of Medication Access, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\")\n\nAs a result, over two-thirds of providers switch to an alternative medication if they encounter a barrier during the specialty prescribing process[ref](# \"Help for the Patient Journey – Electronic Modernization of Medication Access, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") – even though the original therapy may have been their preferred choice.\n\n## Limitations of Traditional Support Services\n\nAs specialty medications are associated with significant access barriers, manufacturers and third-party vendors offer hub support services to guide patients through challenges and fulfill all requirements necessary to begin therapy. Manufacturers often rely on providers to communicate availability of hub support,[ref](# \"Patient Services – Pharma’s Best Kept Secret, Accenture Life Sciences, 2015\") but this information rarely reaches patients. Survey research indicates that only one in five patients are aware of hub support.[ref](# \"Patient Services – Pharma’s Best Kept Secret, Accenture Life Sciences, 2015\")\n\nBeyond these patient intake dilemmas, traditional hub support services rely on outdated communications channels (*e.g.,* phone calls and faxes) to fulfill enrollment criteria and start patients on therapy, which may require upwards of 70 touchpoints among health care stakeholders.[ref](# \"Specialty Pharmacy: Why Does It Take So Long?, Specialty Pharmacy Times, 2017\") As a result, time-to-therapy can extend eight weeks from when a prescription is written even with hub support.[ref](# \"The Impact of Disease-Modifying Therapy Access Barriers on People with Multiple Sclerosis: Mixed-Methods Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018\"),[ref](# \"Hub Services Special Report 2016, Pharmaceutical Commerce, 2016\")\n\nCompounding this issue, traditional hub service providers typically operate based on a full-time employee (FTE) cost structure[ref](# \"Hub Services Special Report 2016, Pharmaceutical Commerce, 2016\") so there is little incentive to increase productivity and efficiency. For the FTE model, as more patients are enrolled in a hub program, more FTEs are needed to complete corresponding case work. As a result, more employees must be hired to keep up with the increased workload such that total program costs can rise precipitously.","isKeyTakeaway":false}],"__typename":"SectionBlockBodyCollection"}},{"__typename":"SectionBlock","sys":{"id":"1qknKN75bonSE6mmlkMkUO","__typename":"Sys"},"title":"About AMP: Access for More Patients™","intro":"A customizable electronic platform for hub support services created by CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads by McKesson in response to deficiencies of the traditional hub model and the needs of patients and providers.

Through the portal, information can be shared in real-time and each stakeholder is notified when action is required on their part. In this report, we describe results from a two-month pilot study where AMP was implemented for a specialty medication in the neurology therapeutic area to positively impact patients with a 27 percent reduction in time-to-therapy.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds data on file\")\n\n![AMP intake WEB](//images.ctfassets.net/2in405srp47m/2oHMFJGHma7c3AVvIRjCjz/5776f1e02ff1b446d7b5b4f9704a9fd6/AMP_intake_WEB.jpg)\n\n## Capabilities\n\n__Patient Intake at the Point of Prescribing:__ As e-prescriptions for specialty medications can trigger enrollment into AMP, potentially all patients have access to support services. If medications are manually prescribed, enrollment can be started directly in the specialty web portal. Traditional enrollment via fax is also available. \n\n__Clear Path to Viral Adoption:__ AMP was developed as an extension of the CoverMyMeds provider portal with an existing user base of over 700,000 providers. For some therapeutic areas, over 90 percent of prospective national provider identifiers (NPIs) have accessed the portal in the last 90 days. For this study, there was 94 percent overlap between the manufacturer’s prospective NPI list and regular CoverMyMeds portal users. \n\n__Electronic Processes:__ Patient enrollment and consent, benefits investigation and verification (BI/BV), financial assistance, prior authorization (PA) and scheduling lab tests can be requested or completed electronically to help decrease time-to-therapy for patients.\n\n__Centralized Access:__ The CoverMyMeds portal can serve as the single access point for specialty medications for all health care stakeholders. Through an online dashboard, patient case status and progress can be tracked, giving providers, patient service coordinators and case managers a longitudinal view of their patient’s journey.\n\n__Exception Management:__ When a patient case deviates from the standardized AMP workflow, expert case managers are on standby to fulfill any outstanding tasks for starting therapy.\n\n__Ongoing Adherence Support:__ Patient data is continuously tracked and monitored for comprehensive outcomes reporting with added support from RxCrossroads by McKesson. Tech-enabled tools and programs may be used to help patients remain on therapy.
