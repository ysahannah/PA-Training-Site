debilitation for nearly one million Americans. Novel therapies exist that can help slow disease progression and limit new symptoms. Without assistance from support services, MS patients face significant challenges in accessing, affording and adhering to these complex, specialty medications. This report describes major barriers keeping MS patients from needed therapies along with inefficiencies of the traditional model for patient access and support services that suppress enrollment and delay time to therapy. A new technological innovation from CoverMyMeds that solves for these specialty access and support problems is introduced.</p></div></div></div><div class=" o-hero-grid__cell o-hero-grid__cell--row-9 o-hero-grid__cell--row-1@60 o-hero-grid__cell--row-span-8 o-hero-grid__cell--row-span-16@60 o-hero-grid__cell--col-1 o-hero-grid__cell--col-10@60 o-hero-grid__cell--col-span-16 o-hero-grid__cell--col-span-7@60 u-color-black "><div class="o-form-page__form"><h2 class="b-body u-fw-medium">Fill out the form below to access the white paper.</h2><div class=""><form><div class="u-mar-vt-20"><div class="b-body c-textbox"><label for="7amDkeEsNDZteJFMT42wgz_field" class=" c-textbox__label">First Name*</label><input class="b-bare c-textbox__field" type="text" id="7amDkeEsNDZteJFMT42wgz_field" name="firstName" required="" value=""/></div></div><div class="u-mar-vt-20"><div class="b-body c-textbox"><label for="4idQPZ8bn4RDeaR4IKjzG0_field" class=" c-textbox__label">Last Name*</label><input class="b-bare c-textbox__field" type="text" id="4idQPZ8bn4RDeaR4IKjzG0_field" name="lastName" required="" value=""/></div></div><div class="u-mar-vt-20"><div class="b-body c-textbox"><label for="6KsP3p6ZvbXpMnr5i0rIqK_field" class=" c-textbox__label">Company Name*</label><input class="b-bare c-textbox__field" type="text" id="6KsP3p6ZvbXpMnr5i0rIqK_field" name="company" required="" value=""/></div></div><div class="u-mar-vt-20"><div class="b-body c-textbox"><label for="3ENijjonXUuxiKgXVYG29T_field" class=" c-textbox__label">E-mail Address*</label><input class="b-bare c-textbox__field" type="email" id="3ENijjonXUuxiKgXVYG29T_field" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$" name="email" required="" value=""/></div></div><div class="u-disp-flex u-mar-top-40"><div class="b-caption u-color-grey-61 u-align-self-center">* Required</div><button class="c-btn u-mar-left-auto"><span class="c-btn__txt">Access</span></button></div></form></div><div class="b-body u-disp-none u-mar-top-35">There was an error submitting the form.

In fact, a survey of 10,000 patients across several therapeutic areas found that only 19% of patients — about one in five — were aware of these services.[ref](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen/patient-services-survey/Accenture-Mc814-Patient-ServicesLS-Research-Note2015-v7.pdf \"Patient Services – Pharma’s Best Kept Secret, Accenture Life Sciences, 2015\"),[ref](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen-2/patient-services-survey-pharma/pdf/Accenture-patient-services-2016-survey-results-web.pdf \"The Patient Is IN – Pharma’s Growing Opportunity in Patient Services, Accenture Life Sciences, 2016\") Drug manufacturers often communicate with healthcare providers about the availability of support services, but studies show that this information does not readily make it to the patient.[ref](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen/patient-services-survey/Accenture-Mc814-Patient-ServicesLS-Research-Note2015-v7.pdf \"Patient Services – Pharma’s Best Kept Secret, Accenture Life Sciences, 2015\"),[ref](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen-2/patient-services-survey-pharma/pdf/Accenture-patient-services-2016-survey-results-web.pdf \"The Patient Is IN – Pharma’s Growing Opportunity in Patient Services, Accenture Life Sciences, 2016\") Without assistance, patients struggle to navigate challenges associated with specialty medications on their own.\n\n![3 CMM 3721challenges](//images.ctfassets.net/2in405srp47m/7i7oHHAwcWl7LLLpe5BguK/96e4b5f31ca96b77d64be226016cfd45/3_CMM_3721challenges.png)\n\n### Major challenges associated with MS therapies\n\n__Affordability:__ Out-of-pocket spending for insured MS patients is on average three times higher than for the average consumer.[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Advocacy/2018-PPC-Access-to-MS-Meds-Leavebehind_final.pdf \"Access to MS Medications, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 2018\") Some can spend upwards of $7,000 per year for an MS medication, even with insurance.[ref](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.053 \"Trends In Coverage For Disease-Modifying Therapies For Multiple Sclerosis In Medicare Part D, 2019\")\n\n![4 CMM 3721 affordability v2](//images.ctfassets.net/2in405srp47m/7nL3dJwtdYTCaUFffr66NO/188659f12c4e3ef9c1cb911305922d06/4_CMM_3721_affordability_v2.png)\n\n__Clinical Criteria:__ Laboratory tests are often necessary before patients can begin MS therapies. For certain medications, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) may be required to help limit or manage adverse reactions.[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Brochures/Brochure-The-MS-Disease-Modifying-Medications.pdf \"Disease Modifying Therapies for MS, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\") Scheduling and coordinating transportation for tests can be a burden to MS patients or caregivers.[ref](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Brochures/Addressing-Advanced-MS-Care-Needs.pdf \"Addressing Advanced Care Needs of People with MS and Their Families: The Importance of Education, Prevention, Advocacy and Coordinated Comprehensive Care, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\"),[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Brochures/Guidebook-Caring-for-Loved-Ones-with-Advanced-MS-A-Guide-for-Families.pdf \"Caring for Loved Ones with Advanced MS: A Guide for Families, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\")\n\n__Enrollment:__ Support services and financial assistance programs are critical for starting patients on specialty therapies. Knowing the correct enrollment form to use and the right organization to send it to can be unclear and obtaining patient consent for these services can be difficult for healthcare providers. While enrollment portals are sometimes available, providers can have trouble keeping track of login credentials for multiple medications,[ref](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_intelligence/simplifying_hcp_access_to_digital_information_1216451 \"Simplifying HCP Access to Digital Information, PMLiVE, 2018\") which may involve different manufacturers, specialty pharmacies and hub providers.\n\n__Reimbursement:__ Benefits investigation/verification (BI/BV) can significantly impact and delay medication access for patients (i.e. reimbursement processes can be different for claims filed under the pharmacy vs. medical benefit of patients’ health plans).[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/scorecard/specialty/ \"Section 03: Specialty, ePA National Adoption Scorecard, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") While important for optimizing utilization of specialty medications, prior authorization (PA) and step therapy requirements can also be difficult for patients and providers to fulfill.[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234348/?report=classic \"The Impact of Disease-Modifying Therapy Access Barriers on People with Multiple Sclerosis: Mixed-Methods Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018\") Research shows that patients are often left to advance these processes on their own, with some MS patients describing it as a full-time job.[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234348/?report=classic \"The Impact of Disease-Modifying Therapy Access Barriers on People with Multiple Sclerosis: Mixed-Methods Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018\"),[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Advocacy/Recommendations-Make-MS-Meds-Accessible.pdf \"Make MS Medications Accessible: Recommendations, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\")\n\n![7 CMM 3721reimbursement](//images.ctfassets.net/2in405srp47m/3I15KompKiCyKJ8Ayq4viP/ebeb637dfd13f7889d067ae0c556aab9/7_CMM_3721reimbursement.png)\n\n__Communication:__ As starting a specialty medication can require information from many different healthcare stakeholders, knowing who to contact for answers and assistance can be burdensome for patients. Outdated communication channels among stakeholders, including phone calls and faxes, can result in inefficient exchange of critical information that can delay time to therapy and frustrate patients.[ref](https://www.pocp.com/biopharma-automating-specialty-enrollment/ \"Automating Enrollment for Specialty Prescriptions, Point of Care Partners, 2017\")\n\n__Adherence:__ Treatments for MS are typically designed for long-term use, but many patients stop taking their medications prematurely.[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Adherence \"Adherence, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\") Altering dosage, changing insurance coverage, clinical concerns and certain life circumstances can complicate the process for refilling prescriptions and disrupt a patient's ability to consistently take their medication.[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Adherence \"Adherence, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\"),[ref](https://www.pillsy.com/articles/medication-adherence-stats \"Adherence Statistics, Pillsy, 2018\") A literature review of MS patient adherence to common treatments revealed adherence rates as low as 41% in some cases.[ref](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/pdf/10.18553/jmcp.2013.19.s1.S24 \"Narrative Review of the Literature on Adherence to Disease-Modifying Therapies Among Patients with Multiple Sclerosis, 2013\")\n\n![9 CMM 3721 adherence v2](//images.ctfassets.net/2in405srp47m/4XB85Ede40gzDD7aEHj4DL/515eca1714f25068f44afbae866d5632/9_CMM_3721_adherence_v2.png)\n\n### Modernizing specialty support services for MS patients\n\nSupport through hub services must be easily accessible and leverage efficiency to improve access, affordability and adherence for patients. The traditional hub model is unable to touch many patients due to enrollment difficulties. For those patients who are enrolled, lack of visibility into progress can cause frustration and manual exchanges among healthcare stakeholders can delay time to therapy.

If it is an e-prescription, enrollment is automatically triggered within the CoverMyMeds portal for providers that are part of the CoverMyMeds network. If it's a traditional prescription, the provider can still easily start enrollment within the familiar portal. The CoverMyMeds portal is already workflow-integrated with as many as 700,000 providers regularly using it to complete PA requests electronically. In fact, 65% of specialty providers in the neurology therapeutic area have used the CoverMyMeds portal in the last 90 days.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds data on file, 2019\") When considering only certain centers of excellence in neurology, this number jumps to 94% of specialty providers.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds data on file, 2019\")\n\n__2.__ Patient information is autopopulated on electronic enrollment form. Provider completes and submits form. Provider can order services through the enrollment form, including laboratory tests and first dose observation. Patient consent for support services is captured in-office or an email is sent to capture their consent electronically. Patients can now be approached for financial assistance programs.\n\n__3.__ CoverMyMeds helps facilitate scheduling of laboratory tests and first dose observation if needed, uploads test results, helps electronically complete BI/BV and starts an electronic prior authorization (ePA) request. Within the online dashboard, providers have visibility into order progress through a status tracker and stakeholders know which steps need completed and know who is responsible for what. Any complications are fielded through a team of case managers at CoverMyMeds specializing in medication access.\n\n__4.__ Provider electronically clears patient for therapy within the CoverMyMeds portal. If the medication requires REMS, CoverMyMeds connects the patient and provider with the appropriate REMS program.\n\n__5.__ Specialty pharmacy validates the prescription and dispenses the medication. A clean script is sent to an appropriate specialty pharmacy within the limited distribution network for the specialty medication.\n\n__6.__ Automated reminders for refills and ongoing support for any coverage or logistical challenges help patients with medication adherence.\n\n### Innovative medicines need innovative healthcare technology\n\nWhile innovative treatments are available to help manage symptoms and disease progression for MS patients, these specialty medications present patients with distinct challenges. \n\nSupport services offer patients needed assistance to help access, afford and adhere to their medications. Through innovations in healthcare IT, inefficiencies of the traditional hub model that limit support for patients and delay time to therapy are being resolved. \n\nWith a new starting point for specialty medications that is powered by technology, all patients can have the opportunity for effective support on their journeys to better health.\n\n*__To learn more about how technology is changing the landscape of specialty medication access and beyond, visit [go.covermymeds.com/specialty](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/solutions/life-sciences/specialty/?utm_source=article\u0026utm_medium=website\u0026utm_campaign=Living%20With%20MS \"go.covermymeds.com/specialty\").__*\n\n*This report describes major barriers keeping MS patients from needed therapies along with inefficiencies of the traditional model for patient access and support services that suppress enrollment and delay time to therapy.
