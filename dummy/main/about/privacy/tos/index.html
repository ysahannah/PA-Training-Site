<h2 id="what-are-the-privacy-obligations-of-covermymeds">WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY OBLIGATIONS OF COVERMYMEDS?</h2>
<p>CoverMyMeds generally provides its Services as a business associate to health care providers. Therefore, to use the CoverMyMeds Services pursuant to these Terms of Service, health care providers, including employees agreeing to these Terms of Service on behalf of an employer that is a health care provider, must read and agree to the Business Associate Agreement, which is part of these Terms of Service. The Business Associate Agreement requires CoverMyMeds to protect your PHI and specifies the purposes for which it may be lawfully used and disclosed by CoverMyMeds. Use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the terms of the Business Associate Agreement. CoverMyMeds may use subcontractors to assist in performing some of its Services. When these subcontractors have access to PHI, they will enter into business associate agreements with CoverMyMeds to the extent required by applicable law. The Services are provided to you at no cost, dependent upon CoverMyMeds’ ability to share data created or obtained by CoverMyMeds in the course of providing its Services as specified in the Terms of Service and as permitted by law.</p>

<p>To provide the service at no cost to health care providers, CoverMyMeds may share  de-identified data with third parties including, but not limited to, pharmaceutical manufacturers for various purposes such as, but not limited to, billing and validation of certain transactions, evaluating the effectiveness of the Services, and providing data analytics and market insights, including prescribing practices. Additionally, data is used for continuous improvement of current services, such as to improve the end user experience, and streamline the prior authorization process, as well as the development of future products, and services. You acknowledge and agree that CoverMyMeds, or its subcontractors, or both, are hereby authorized to de-identify PHI in accordance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.514(a)-(c) of HIPAA, and subsequently use and disclose such de-identified data as permitted by applicable law, including, without limitation, for CoverMyMeds’ internal business use and third party reporting.</p>

<p>You authorize CoverMyMeds to use and disclose your information provided in connection with the Services, including without limitation, your National Provider Identifier number (“NPI number”), unless prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and authorize that CoverMyMeds may perform data analytics in connection with your prescribing practices, outcomes of PAs submitted, and use and disclose such analytics for CoverMyMeds’ internal business use and third-party reporting.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that CoverMyMeds or its affiliate may also engage directly with patients, and CoverMyMeds or its affiliate may use and disclose PHI pursuant to an authorization that complies with 45 CFR 164. Additionally, you acknowledge that patients may provide information to CoverMyMeds or its affiliate, not as part of the Services, that is the same or substantially similar to information obtained by CoverMyMeds in the course of performing its Services, and that CoverMyMeds’ or affiliate’s use and disclosure of such information is subject exclusively to the agreement or agreements between the patient and CoverMyMeds or its affiliate.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-obligations-when-using-covermymeds">WHAT ARE YOUR OBLIGATIONS WHEN USING COVERMYMEDS?</h2>
<p>Use of the Services constitutes a representation and warranty that all consents and authorizations required to provide PHI, including genetic information such as genetic test results, to CoverMyMeds, and for CoverMyMeds to use and disclose the PHI, including genetic information such as genetic test results, to provide its Services and as otherwise provided herein or in the Business Associate Agreement, have been obtained. In addition, you represent and warrant that you have provided all notices necessary to comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating in any way to medical privacy, or health privacy, or both including, but not limited to a notice of privacy practices.</p>

<p>You must provide current, complete, and accurate information when you create an account to use our Services. You understand that we may collect information such as your name, physical address, email, telephone number, fax number, organization name, job title, and NPI number when you sign up as a user.  Although CoverMyMeds disclaims any legal duty to verify the accuracy of any data that you provide to us when creating an account, if CoverMyMeds believes that any information you provide is not current, complete, and accurate, we have the right to refuse access to the Website or any of our Services, and to terminate or suspend your account. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account as well as for any and all activities that occur by use of your account. You agree to immediately notify CoverMyMeds of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security related to your account. CoverMyMeds will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by CoverMyMeds or another party as a result of someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else’s account or allow anyone else to use your account at any time.</p>

<p>If you are creating an account as an employee of a health care provider, you understand and agree that your account is specific to that health care provider and therefore, if your employment with that health care provider ends or is terminated for any reason, you are no longer permitted to access our Services through that account, and must immediately notify CoverMyMeds at <a href="mailto:privacy@covermymeds.com">privacy@covermymeds.com</a> so we may disable that account. You may update your user profile information or disable your user account at any time by visiting the “Your Preferences” tab after login in, or by sending a request via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@covermymeds.com">privacy@covermymeds.com</a> with the words “UPDATE MY INFORMATION” in the subject line. If you withdraw consent, or disable your account, the business relationship created when you registered and agreed to the Terms of Service is terminated.</p>

<p>Any user can disable his or her user account at any time. Disabling your user account will render your account inaccessible; however, our system is required to maintain a record of user accounts and the contents of each for audit purposes, and we may maintain backup copies of all information for legal and compliance purposes. Other healthcare providers may rely on Protected Health Information previously submitted while you were an active user after you disable your account.</p>

<p>PA forms, other forms, and services made available to users are configured to collect only the minimum necessary amount of information that the payer organization or regulatory entity which created the form requested. A user must submit PHI in order to utilize the Services available on this website. Other healthcare providers will receive and use PHI a user submits in order to facilitate the provision of Services to the user.<br />
