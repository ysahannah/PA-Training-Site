This report also considers the healthcare impact of PA, describes technology that has made a positive difference so far and identifies where progress is still needed.</p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Additionally, as utilization of complex, specialty medications continues to increase, a growing need for next-generation patient support services to navigate unique healthcare challenges is described. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Contributions from all network participants, including providers*, pharmacies, payers and life sciences companies, are needed to overcome key disruptors to the patient journey that negatively influence outcomes. Within this report, industry statistics, market research and new survey data illustrate the need for network-driven change to break down the barriers to medication access and help improve the lives of patients. Detailed analysis of established and emerging healthcare IT solutions for these patient challenges is provided in topical, follow-up reports. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">The Medication Access Report is developed in consultation with an advisory board of healthcare experts representing major organizations across the industry – each with unique perspectives, interests and opinions. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">*<em>We define “provider” as a prescriber and any member of their care team, inclusive of nurses, medical assistants, office managers and prior authorization specialists</em></p></div></section><section id="7k1pkV8r5nCNF80IRgYm14" class="u-mar-top-80 u-pad-top-80@80 u-clear-both u-outline-none" tabindex="-1"><div class="o-report-content o-report-content--wide"><h1 class="b-body-copy b-body-copy--extra-large b-body-copy--serif">Consumers in Healthcare</h1><p class="b-body-copy b-body-copy--medium u-mar-vt-20 u-mar-vt-40@80">Choice and convenience are at an all-time high for the American consumer.

For this reason, RTBC must provide accurate, comprehensive information every time it&#x27;s needed – underlining the importance of high accuracy and response rates in RTBC solutions. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Instead of uncertainty about prescriptions, with patients unaware of their options and in the dark about what they will pay at the pharmacy, RTBC can create opportunities for patients to get the medications they need within the framework of their unique health, coverage and financial situations. For example, as many patients on fixed incomes or under financial strain struggle to afford their medications during the deductible period of their health plan, RTBC can empower them with cheaper options (e.g., generic alternatives, patient assistance programs, etc.) that may work within their budgets. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Other people may never reach their deductible in a given year. For such instances, it may make more sense to pay for medications off-benefit if the cash price is cheapest, which happens more often than many realize.<span class="c-inline-reference "><sup><button class="b-bare" aria-label="Footnote 27" aria-expanded="false">27</button></sup><span class="b-caption u-color-black u-fw-normal c-inline-reference__content" data-footnote-number="27" start="27"><a class="b-link" target="_blank" href="https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/overpaying-for-prescription-drugs/">Overpaying for Prescription Drugs: The Copay Clawback Phenomenon</a></span></span> Where RTBC solutions may be limited in helping these patients, PDS solutions can give insight into such off-benefit details. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Effective RTBC solutions can alert providers to formulary restrictions or exclusions while offering options to begin a PA request electronically, at the point of prescribing, or switch to an on-formulary clinical alternative. While some patients may be comfortable waiting for a PA request to be approved, others may want their medication as soon as possible. In such a case, providers may suggest clinical alternatives to avoid PA and any potential delay in time to therapy. By moving the decision to begin or avoid PA to the point of prescribing, RTBC offers a long-term strategy for mitigating and streamlining PA volume that still largely occurs at the pharmacy. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">For additional details on the features and capabilities of RTBC solutions, along with a look at how healthcare stakeholders contribute and benefit, <a class="u-color-magenta" href="https://covermymeds.com/main/medication-access-report/prescription-decision-support/" title="2020 Report on Prescription Decision Support">read our 2020 report on prescription decision support</a>. </p></div><div class="o-report-content"><h2 class="b-body-copy b-body-copy--medium u-mar-top-40 u-mar-top-80@80 u-mar-bottom-20 u-mar-bottom-40@80 u-fw-medium">Price Transparency and Choice at Any Time</h2><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Through online retailers like Amazon, consumers are accustomed to evaluating products on factors like quality, convenience and price before making a selection and purchase. Unfortunately, this level of price transparency and choice for prescription medications is scarcely available in healthcare to this point. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">While RTBC technology is empowering decision making at the point of prescribing, extending prescription decision support to any stage of the patient journey will have the most impact for helping patients get the medications they need to live healthy lives. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Before leaving the provider’s office, patients are typically asked their preference for where prescriptions should be sent. For many, the answer to this question is the first large chain pharmacy that is familiar or perceived as convenient to them. </p><p class="u-mar-vt-20">Unfortunately, patients may not be aware that this choice can impact their out-of-pocket costs. As an unintended consequence, patients may perceive that there are no other options for where/how to fill (e.g., preferred pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies, price shopping apps, etc.). </p></div><figure class="o-report-content o-report-content--pull-left"><picture class="o-picture"><source srcSet="

For example, by moving the manual hub model to an existing technology platform already connected with major network stakeholders, a new patient support solution can now electronically complete more steps within the specialty workflow.

This first installment of the annual Medication Access Report aims to bring attention to healthcare barriers that leave people without the medications they need to live healthy lives, while also introducing advances in healthcare IT that stand to make a positive impact. \n\nPatients now expect transparency, accessibility and options as they journey along the healthcare continuum. To make informed healthcare decisions, patients need support and curated information. This report examines the trend of patient consumerism and how the market is responding with tools to empower patients through choice and visibility. \n\nOngoing inhibitors of efficient care and medication access, such as prior authorization (PA), can delay time to therapy for patients. This report also considers the healthcare impact of PA, describes technology that has made a positive difference so far and identifies where progress is still needed.\n\nAdditionally, as utilization of complex, specialty medications continues to increase, a growing need for next-generation patient support services to navigate unique healthcare challenges is described. \n\nContributions from all network participants, including providers*, pharmacies, payers and life sciences companies, are needed to overcome key disruptors to the patient journey that negatively influence outcomes. Within this report, industry statistics, market research and new survey data illustrate the need for network-driven change to break down the barriers to medication access and help improve the lives of patients. Detailed analysis of established and emerging healthcare IT solutions for these patient challenges is provided in topical, follow-up reports. \n\nThe Medication Access Report is developed in consultation with an advisory board of healthcare experts representing major organizations across the industry – each with unique perspectives, interests and opinions. \n\n**We define “provider” as a prescriber and any member of their care team, inclusive of nurses, medical assistants, office managers and prior authorization specialists*","metaName":"Access Barriers Text"}]},{"contentType":"blockReportSection","sectionId":"7k1pkV8r5nCNF80IRgYm14","sectionTitle":"Consumers in Healthcare","sectionShortTitle":"Healthcare Consumerism","sectionIntro":"Choice and convenience are at an all-time high for the American consumer.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates that 173 million Americans under the age of 65 were covered through employer-based or non-group health insurance plans in 2019.[ref](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-05/55085-HealthCoverageSubsidies_0.pdf \"Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2019 to 2026, Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Office, 2019\") Of those with employer-based insurance, 45.6 percent are covered under high deductible health plans (i.e., deductible of at least $1,350 for self-only coverage and $2,700 for family coverage) per the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – a more than 30 percent increase since 2007.[ref](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db317.pdf \"High-deductible Health Plan Enrollment Among Adults Aged 18–64 With Employment-based Insurance Coverage, National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018\"),[ref](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201902.pdf \"Health Insurance Coverage: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey, January–September 2018, Division of Health Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, 2019\") ","metaName":"Consumerism Block 1"},{"contentType":"blockQuote","metaName":"QUOTE - Year-over-year deductible growth","alignment":"right","quoteText":"Year-over-year deductible growth outpaces wage growth *more than six-fold.[ref](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/10/08/503575.htm \"Employees’ Share of Health Costs Continues Rising Faster Than Wages, Insurance Journal, 2018\"),[ref](http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2019 \"Employer Health Benefits 2019 Annual Survey, Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019\")*"},{"contentType":"blockText","text":"Those under 65 and covered under high-deductible plans are estimated to account for 52 percent of all prescription volume in the U.S. (i.e.,~three billion prescriptions).[ref](#\t\"Market Research, McKesson Corporation, 2020\"),[ref](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-review-of-2017-outlook-to-2022 \"Medicine Use and Spending in the U.S., A Review of 2017 and Outlook to 2022, IQIVIA Institute, 2018\") As enrollment into high-deductible health plans continues to swell, deductible amounts are rising in tandem. In fact, year-over-year deductible growth since 2009 (162 percent) outpaces wage growth by more than six-fold (26 percent).[ref](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/10/08/503575.htm \"Employees’ Share of Health Costs Continues Rising Faster Than Wages, Insurance Journal, 2018\"),[ref](http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2019 \"Employer Health Benefits 2019 Annual Survey, Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019\") In other words, patients are expected to pay disproportionately more out of pocket for their healthcare while receiving no additional funds to offset the cost.\n\nDeductibles for traditional health plans are also climbing as the average for single coverage workers increased from $460 in 2007 to $1,153 in 2018 (i.e., a 124 percent increase) – only 27 percent less than high-deductible health plans after employer-sponsored health savings account contributions.[ref](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db317.pdf \"High-deductible Health Plan Enrollment Among Adults Aged 18–64 With Employment-based Insurance Coverage, National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018\") Some patients (e.g., 17 percent of commercially insured patients) can even pay a separate pharmacy deductible for prescription medications in addition to their regular deductible.[ref](https://www.pbmi.com/ItemDetail?iProductCode=BDR_2017&Category=BDR \"2017 Trends in Drug Benefit Design Report, Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute, 2017\")\n\nMonthly health insurance premiums are paid in addition to deductibles and continue to increase as well. In 2018, the average worker paid ~$575 per month in premiums for self-only coverage or $1,635 per month for family coverage, representing 54 percent and 62 percent increases since 2007 (relative to ~21 percent cumulative inflation rate), respectively.[ref](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201902.pdf \"Health Insurance Coverage: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey, January–September 2018, Division of Health Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, 2019\")\n\nThe burdens of high deductibles and high premiums result in many Americans falling into an unfortunate category: underinsured. While it’s estimated that 30 million Americans are completely uninsured, as many as 86 million – nearly three-fold more – may be underinsured {i.e., commercial plans (45.6% x 159 million) and Marketplace plans via the Affordable Care Act (90% x 14 million)}.[ref](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-05/55085-HealthCoverageSubsidies_0.pdf \"Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2019 to 2026, Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Office, 2019\") Considering the total U.S. population (~330 million), this means that over one third of Americans are either uninsured or underinsured.\n\nMore specifically, a survey published in 2019 by The Commonwealth Fund found that ~44 million Americans fit at least one criterion of underinsured: out-of-pocket costs equaling 10 percent or more of their income (five percent or more if low-income) or deductibles equaling five percent or more of their income.[ref](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2019-02/Collins_hlt_ins_coverage_8_years_after_ACA_2018_biennial_survey_tables.pdf#page=1 \"Survey Brief Tables, Health Insurance Coverage Eight Years After the ACA: Fewer Uninsured Americans and Shorter Coverage Gaps, but More Underinsured, The Commonwealth Fund, 2019\"),[ref](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/feb/health-insurance-coverage-eight-years-after-aca \"Health Insurance Coverage Eight Years After the ACA: Fewer Uninsured Americans and Shorter Coverage Gaps, but More Underinsured, The Commonwealth Fund, 2019\") In addition, 20 million others experienced an insurance coverage gap in 2018 and were responsible for all of their healthcare expenses during that time.[ref](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2019-02/Collins_hlt_ins_coverage_8_years_after_ACA_2018_biennial_survey_tables.pdf#page=1 \"Survey Brief Tables, Health Insurance Coverage Eight Years After the ACA: Fewer Uninsured Americans and Shorter Coverage Gaps, but More Underinsured, The Commonwealth Fund, 2019\"),[ref](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/feb/health-insurance-coverage-eight-years-after-aca \"Health Insurance Coverage Eight Years After the ACA: Fewer Uninsured Americans and Shorter Coverage Gaps, but More Underinsured, The Commonwealth Fund, 2019\")\n\nInadequate or spotty coverage has clear implications for finances and health. Nearly half of underinsured respondents in the survey reported difficulty paying for medical bills (~two times more than the adequately insured) and 41 percent admitted to delaying needed care due to cost considerations.[ref](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/feb/health-insurance-coverage-eight-years-after-aca \"Health Insurance Coverage Eight Years After the ACA: Fewer Uninsured Americans and Shorter Coverage Gaps, but More Underinsured, The Commonwealth Fund, 2019\") ","metaName":"Consumerism Block 2"},{"contentType":"blockPicture","metaTitle":"Underinsured Graphic","alt":"The uninsured and underinsured account for one third of all Americans.

As a group, high-deductible plan members and the uninsured account for ~116 million people that are fully exposed to healthcare expenses for at least part of the year.\n\nIt’s estimated that only one quarter to one third of high-deductible plan members even reach their deductible for a given year and the extrapolated date by which an average patient hits the average deductible has now extended late into May.[ref](https://www.iqvia.com/-/media/iqvia/pdfs/institute-reports/emergence-and-impact-of-pharmacy-deductibles.pdf \"Emergence and Impact of Pharmacy Deductibles: Implications for Patients in Commercial Health Plans, IQIVIA Institute, 2015\"),[ref](# \"Industry Research, McKesson Corporation, 2020\"),[ref](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/deductible-relief-day-how-rising-deductibles-are-affecting-people-with-employer-coverage/ \"Deductible Relief Day: How rising deductibles are affecting people with employer coverage, Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, 2019\")\n\nDuring the deductible period of health plans, when the cost of care falls entirely to the patient, prescription abandonment and medication non-adherence can climb significantly. In fact, one of four prescriptions are abandoned by patients during the deductible period, compared to only one in ten prescriptions when there is no deductible.[ref](https://structurecms-staging-psyclone.netdna-ssl.com/client_assets/dwonk/media/attachments/590c/6aa0/6970/2d2d/4182/0000/590c6aa069702d2d41820000.pdf \"Medicine Use and Spending in the U.S., A Review of 2016 and Outlook to 2021, IQIVIA Institute, 2017\")\n\nEvidence suggests that prescription abandonment scales with out-of-pocket costs. For prescriptions under $50, abandonment (i.e., proportion of patients with approval from their insurer but do not initiate therapy) can range from eight percent ($0 – 9.99) to 21 percent ($40.00 – 49.99). As costs escalate beyond $250, prescription abandonment can reach 69 percent.[ref](https://www.iqvia.com/locations/united-states/library/case-studies/patient-affordability-part-two \"Patient Affordability Part Two, Implications for Patient Behavior and Therapy Consumption, IQIVIA Institute, 2018\") While a $250 claim may seem far-fetched, the average claim for patients with high deductibles and commercial insurance was $270 in 2017.[ref](https://www.iqvia.com/locations/united-states/library/case-studies/patient-affordability-part-one \"Patient Affordability Part One, The Implications of Changing Benefit Designs and High Cost-Sharing, IQIVIA Institute, 2018\")\n\nEmpowering patients as consumers of health can help to ease the economic pressures burdening many patients – potentially improving their access to medications they need to live healthy lives. Prescription price transparency and affordability options for patients at each stage of their journeys may help mitigate the economic and social challenges that are exacerbated by high-deductible plans and rising out-of-pocket spending.

For insured patients, prescription choice and availability are often limited by formulary status and tier placement of medications.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/a-brief-history-of-drug-formularies-and-what-to-expect-in-2019/ \"A Brief History of Drug Formularies And What to Expect in 2019, CoverMyMeds, 2018\")\n\nEach year, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) evaluate medications for inclusion or exclusion from their national formulary lists based on such factors as clinical efficacy, safety, cost and cost effectiveness.

PDS technologies deliver benefit details and off-benefit options that are useful for confident and informed healthcare decision-making. These tools can be applied at the point of prescribing and beyond to empower patients as consumers.\n\nReal-time benefit check (RTBC) is a key component of PDS that provides benefit transparency and choice at the point of prescribing. By surfacing prescription coverage, accurate out-of-pocket costs and clinical alternatives, standard RTBC solutions can enable practical care conversations between patients and providers inclusive of clinical, financial and temporal factors. Some RTBC solutions can even provide off-benefit information, such as cash price for medications and availability of patient assistance programs, to give a more complete view of available options.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of surveyed providers (86 percent) agree that a reliable RTBC solution would benefit patients and assist them during prescription decision making.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/rtbc-scorecard/ \"2018 Real-Time Benefit Check National Adoption Scorecard, CoverMyMeds, 2018\") Over 70 percent of surveyed nurses consider it their responsibility to find prescription options that fit within patients’ unique coverage and financial situations.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds Nurses Survey, 2019\")\n\nWithout an RTBC solution, only 32 percent of nurses expressed satisfaction in their current ability to find information regarding their patients’ out-of-pocket costs for medications and only 33 percent were satisfied with their ability to find which medications were covered by their patients’ health plans.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds Nurses Survey, 2019\") Finding such information can be difficult – 73 percent of nurses claim that what they need is not located in one single location and is instead scattered across multiple resources.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds Nurses Survey, 2019\")","metaName":"Price Transparency at POP Block 3"},{"contentType":"blockQuote","metaName":"QUOTE - Provider Trust","alignment":"left","quoteText":"*79% of providers seldom trust* formulary and benefit information available in their EHR.[ref](# \"CoverMyMeds Patient and Provider Surveys, 2020\")"},{"contentType":"blockText","text":"Given that patients see providers as the most trusted healthcare stakeholder,[ref](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/accenture/next-gen/patient-services-survey/accenture-mc814-patient-servicesls-research-note2015-v7.pdf \"Patient Services – Pharma’s Best Kept Secret, Accenture, 2015\") RTBC can be a crucial resource for providers at a critical moment in the patient journey. For this reason, RTBC must provide accurate, comprehensive information every time it's needed – underlining the importance of high accuracy and response rates in RTBC solutions. \n\nInstead of uncertainty about prescriptions, with patients unaware of their options and in the dark about what they will pay at the pharmacy, RTBC can create opportunities for patients to get the medications they need within the framework of their unique health, coverage and financial situations. For example, as many patients on fixed incomes or under financial strain struggle to afford their medications during the deductible period of their health plan, RTBC can empower them with cheaper options (e.g., generic alternatives, patient assistance programs, etc.) that may work within their budgets. \n\nOther people may never reach their deductible in a given year. For such instances, it may make more sense to pay for medications off-benefit if the cash price is cheapest, which happens more often than many realize.[ref](https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/overpaying-for-prescription-drugs/ \"Overpaying for Prescription Drugs: The Copay Clawback Phenomenon\") Where RTBC solutions may be limited in helping these patients, PDS solutions can give insight into such off-benefit details. \n\nEffective RTBC solutions can alert providers to formulary restrictions or exclusions while offering options to begin a PA request electronically, at the point of prescribing, or switch to an on-formulary clinical alternative. While some patients may be comfortable waiting for a PA request to be approved, others may want their medication as soon as possible. In such a case, providers may suggest clinical alternatives to avoid PA and any potential delay in time to therapy. By moving the decision to begin or avoid PA to the point of prescribing, RTBC offers a long-term strategy for mitigating and streamlining PA volume that still largely occurs at the pharmacy. \n\nFor additional details on the features and capabilities of RTBC solutions, along with a look at how healthcare stakeholders contribute and benefit, [read our 2020 report on prescription decision support](https://covermymeds.com/main/medication-access-report/prescription-decision-support/ \"2020 Report on Prescription Decision Support\").

As a result, few healthcare advances have quickly gained as much support and widespread stakeholder adoption as ePA.\n\n## Evolution of Electronic Prior Authorization\n\nIn 2011, the American Medical Association released a white paper urging the federal government and the healthcare industry to develop standards and technology for real-time transmission and processing of PA requests.[ref](https://massneuro.org/Resources/Transfer%20from%20old%20sit/AMA%20White%20Paper%20on%20Standardizing%20Prior%20Authorization.pdf \"Standardization of prior authorization process for medical services white paper, American Medical Association, 2011\") This recommendation was the culmination of years of frustration and dedicated efforts from industry stakeholders. Today, nearly 100 percent of pharmacies, pharmacy system vendors, payers/PBMs and electronic health records (EHR) systems are integrated with an ePA solution and legislation at the federal and state levels requires the use of standardized, electronic methods to complete requests.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/scorecard/ \"2019 ePA National Adoption Scorecard, CoverMyMeds, 2019\")\n\nOver time, the use of standard PA request forms have evolved along with a four-part electronic transaction developed by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) termed the SCRIPT-standard.[ref](https://www.ncpdp.org/NCPDP/media/pdf/NCPDP_SCRIPT_ePA_Standard.pdf \"SCRIPT Electronic Prior Authorization Transactions Overview, National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, 2013\") Such progressive standards help to encourage consistent payer forms, drug-specific PA criteria and real-time determinations on PA requests.\n\nThe widespread success of ePA can be partly attributed to the value it brings to all areas of the healthcare network while achieving the common goal of helping patients get the medications they need to live healthy lives. By simplifying and streamlining the PA process, ePA creates efficiencies within stakeholder workflows that saves time and limits administrative costs. \n","metaName":"Tech Adoption Block 4"},{"contentType":"blockPicture","metaTitle":"ePA Availability Graphic","alt":"Graphic depicting three rings representing EHR, payer and pharmacy healthcare network stakeholders.

As the majority of PA volume is considered retrospective (i.e., begins at the pharmacy, after claim rejection), pharmacists have traditionally served as liaison between providers and payers for millions of PA requests each year. The associated administrative workload contributed to nearly three quarters of surveyed pharmacists expressing a desire to spend less time dealing with insurance activities and more time counseling patients.[ref](https://www.amerisourcebergen.com/-/media/assets/amerisourcebergen/pharmacy-checkup/abc-pharmacy-checkup-survey_final.pdf?la=en&hash=33487CFA6F5715036DF2C3EAA3FD2DD517ADDE92 \"AmerisourceBergen Pharmacy Check-Up: Activities and Barriers to Care Analysis, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Maru/Matchbox, 2018\")\n\nIn the short-term, ePA has allowed pharmacies to easily initiate PA requests for providers to complete – helping to mitigate challenges accompanying excessive retrospective PA volume. In some cases, intelligent ePA technology can even recognize if prescriptions will require PA and automatically initiate requests electronically. In the long-term, ePA enables a strategy to divert retrospective PA volume at the pharmacy to the point of prescribing (i.e., prospective ePA) through combination with PDS tools, like RTBC.

In fact, certain ePA solutions are compatible with all payers and any medication – including specialty medications covered under the pharmacy benefit.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/scorecard/ \"2019 ePA National Adoption Scorecard, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") Since 2014, PA volume for specialty medications through a large ePA vendor increased over 1,000 percent.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/scorecard/ \"2019 ePA National Adoption Scorecard, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") Continued advances in ePA technology even allow providers to leverage dynamic form fields and attach clinical documents to assist in completion of any unusual requests. \n\nBeyond promoting awareness of the capabilities and associated benefits of ePA, continued legislative efforts and operational changes from industry stakeholders can help to move the needle towards complete provider adoption. \n\nIn 2019, Congress passed H.R.6 which contained a provision stipulating use of ePA for medications covered under Medicare Part D.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/scorecard/ \"2019 ePA National Adoption Scorecard, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") As government-sponsored payers make appropriate changes to comply with this legislation, commercial payers will likely follow suit. Such incremental advances will encourage provider adoption as payers explicitly direct PA volume through the electronic channel.\n\nAs health systems create significant PA volume, they represent major opportunities for provider adoption of ePA. According to the American Medical Association, an average provider completes around 31 PA requests per week.[ref](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2019-02/prior-auth-2018.pdf \"2018 AMA Prior Authorization (PA) Physician Survey, American Medical Association, 2019\") Considering that health systems employ hundreds of providers, these sites of care generate significant PA volume.  \n\nAs a result, providers are turning to centralized teams dedicated to managing PA requests and associated administrative work for entire health systems. By integrating ePA as a key component of centralized team workflow, meaningful progress towards widespread provider adoption can be made. \n\nFor more details on current efforts to promote provider adoption of ePA, [read our 2020 report on ePA](https://covermymeds.com/main/medication-access-report/electronic-prior-authorization/ \"2020 Report on Electronic Prior Authorization\").","metaName":"Tech Adoption Block 7"}]},{"contentType":"blockReportSection","sectionId":"3sFIRPRFNYncVUdYKt5aiC","sectionTitle":"The Need for Next-Level Patient Support for Specialty Medications","sectionShortTitle":"Patient Support for Specialty Medications","sectionIntro":"Due to their complexity, associated health risks and high costs, specialty medications pose significant access barriers to patients.

Other specialty characterists can include consistent patient monitoring through lab tests or regular checkups and time-intensive processes, including enrollment documentation, benefit verification (i.e., coverage determination, medical or pharmacy benefit) safety and educational components, PA as well as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS).\n\nPatients prescribed specialty medications often experience three major pain points of access, affordability and adherence. The process for receiving a specialty medication is not as simple as walking into a retail pharmacy with a prescription. Given the expense and complexity of specialty medications, both payers and life science manufacturers closely monitor utilization, whether to ensure clinical necessity or patient safety. Clinical and administrative requirements must be completed before patients can begin specialty therapy. \n\nWithout stakeholder support, the responsibility of coordinating care activities typically falls to patients, which can promote prescription abandonment, delay time to therapy and harm healthcare outcomes. \n\nIn several studies, patients described the time and effort required to start a specialty therapy as a full-time job – citing upwards of 30 phone calls to various healthcare stakeholders and many hours gathering information to obtain coverage.[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234348/?report=classic \"The Impact of Disease-Modifying Therapy Access Barriers on People With Multiple Sclerosis: Mixed-Methods Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018\"),[ref](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Advocacy/Recommendations-Make-MS-Meds-Accessible.pdf \"Make MS Medications Accessible: Recommendations, National Multiple Sclerosis Society\") Patients also reported waiting eight weeks or more to receive their first dose of therapy – during this time, disease symptoms often progressed while patient health deteriorated.[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234348/?report=classic \"The Impact of Disease-Modifying Therapy Access Barriers on People With Multiple Sclerosis: Mixed-Methods Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018\")","metaName":"Specialty Block 3"},{"contentType":"blockPicture","metaTitle":"Adherence Graphic","alt":"Graphic depicting three statistics related to patient adherence to specialty medications.

By promoting awareness and installing operational changes, industry stakeholders can drive behavioral changes and meaningful use to help more patients. \n\nFor more detailed analysis on each medication access solution, download our individual reports on [prescription decision support](https://covermymeds.com/main/medication-access-report/prescription-decision-support/ \"2020 Report on Prescription Decision Support\"), [electronic prior authorization](https://covermymeds.com/main/medication-access-report/electronic-prior-authorization/ \"2020 Report on Electronic Prior Authorization\") and [specialty patient support](https://covermymeds.com/main/medication-access-report/specialty-patient-support/ \"2020 Report on Specialty Patient Support\"), where we take a closer look at network contributions, benefits and participation. Please direct any inquiries to medicationaccessreport@covermymeds.com. \n\n## Research Methodology\n\nSurveys to patients and providers were conducted over a four-week period during November and December of 2019. A minimum threshold of 400 responses was used to achieve statistical significance during data analysis. \n\nThe patient survey was completed in collaboration with Snow Companies LLC, included a $20 cash incentive for completion and leveraged the network of PatientWorthy.com to better reach patients with rarer diseases more likely to take specialty medications. The survey was separated into two sections querying patients’ experiences with retail and specialty medications, respectively. Approximately half of surveyed patients reported to have at some point taken a specialty medication, which were defined as high-cost therapies for treating rare or chronic conditions that can require additional patient education/support and unique administration (e.g., oral, injection, infusion). Patients without experience with specialty medications were directed to end the survey before the specialty-specific section.\n\nThe provider survey leveraged the network of CoverMyMeds, which includes over 700,000 providers, and no incentive was applied. \n\nMarket research was conducted by CoverMyMeds and involved literature review of reputable sources as well as focus group discussions with patients and industry stakeholders.
