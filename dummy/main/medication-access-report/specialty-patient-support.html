Knowing these differences is important for understanding why patients can struggle with access. ","sectionBlocks":[{"contentType":"blockText","text":"## Scientific Complexity\n\nSpecialty therapies can go beyond managing symptoms to treating the underlying causes of disease. They often have targeted mechanisms of action and may be large macromolecules, termed biologics.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/the-rise-of-specialty-medications/ \"The Rise of Specialty Medications: Hope for Patients, Hurdle for Healthcare, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") Cell and gene therapies are also emerging as effective new treatment options for those with cancer and rare disease.[ref](https://www.mckesson.com/documents/manufacturers/commercializing-gene-therapies-and-orphan-drugs/ \"The Key to Commercializing Revolutionary Gene Therapies and Other Orphan Drugs: High-Touch Services that Enhance Patient Outcomes, McKesson\")\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\nOften indicated for rare/complex diseases, specialty therapies can be granted priority status by the U.S. FDA, which allows for accelerated or even abbreviated review processes.[ref](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review \"Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018\"),[ref](https://www.fda.gov/industry/developing-products-rare-diseases-conditions/designating-orphan-product-drugs-and-biological-products \"Designating an Orphan Product: Drugs and Biological Products, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018\") However, clinical trial enrollment for specialty medications can be constrained by relatively small patient populations.[ref](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/rare-disease-clinical-trial-enrollment-challenges/439858/ \"Clinical Trial Enrollment Gets Harder as Patient Populations Shrink, BioPharmaDive, 2017\") \n\nFor these reasons, data on efficacy and safety may be less complete compared to the standard approval process.[ref](https://www.mckesson.com/documents/manufacturers/real-world-evidence-and-ehr-patient-outcomes/ \"Real-World Evidence: Leveraging Electronic Health Records to Improve Patient Outcomes, McKesson Specialty Health, 2017\") As a result, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) programs to ensure that clinical benefits outweigh the risks and to limit occurrence of adverse events.[ref](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/risk-evaluation-and-mitigation-strategies-rems \"Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019\") \n\n## Route of Medication Administration\n\nConsistent with their varying scientific complexity, specialty therapies are often administered in unique ways. Many are not amenable to pill form for simple oral administration. As a result, patients may take their medications via nebulization, subcutaneous injection, intramuscular injection or infusion.[ref](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/the-ins-and-outs-of-specialty-pharmacy \"The Ins and Outs of Specialty Pharmacy, Pharmacy Times, 2018\")\n\nThe designated route of administration can influence where patients receive therapy – while some patients may be able to stay home, others may need to go to a provider's office or outpatient facility with clinical staff on standby.[ref](https://www1.magellanrx.com/documents/2019/03/medical-pharmacy-trend-report_2018.pdf/ \"Medical Pharmacy Trend Report, Magellan Rx Management, 2018\")\n\n## Narrow Patient Populations\n\nSpecialty medications typically treat relatively small patient populations for diseases like multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as certain types of cancers and autoimmune conditions to name a few. \n\nRare diseases can affect even fewer people – patient populations of less than 200,000 in the United States.[ref](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/pages/31/faqs-about-rare-diseases \"FAQs from Genetic and Rare Disease Information Center, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\") As certain locations may have too many or too few patients, open distribution of specialty medications is not always economical because of supply-and-demand issues and product expiration – especially biologic, cell and gene therapies which require strict temperature control and have short shelf lives.[ref](https://www.mckesson.com/documents/manufacturers/commercializing-gene-therapies-and-orphan-drugs/ \"The Key to Commercializing Revolutionary Gene Therapies and Other Orphan Drugs: High-Touch Services that Enhance Patient Outcomes, McKesson\"),[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706163/pdf/bth05_2p050.pdf \"The Evolution of Specialty Pharmacy, Biotechnology Healthcare, 2008\")\n\nTo avoid these logistical challenges, manufacturers often dispense specialty medications through exclusive or limited distribution networks (LDNs) of select pharmacies – but this can create barriers to patient access.[ref](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/the-ins-and-outs-of-specialty-pharmacy \"The Ins and Outs of Specialty Pharmacy, Pharmacy Times, 2018\"),[ref](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/473787/EL-White-Paper-Controlling-Cost-of-Specialty-Drugs_Final.pdf \"Managing the Costs of Specialty Drugs, Elsevier, 2017\") \n\n## Cost\n\nWhile representing only 2.2 percent of U.S. prescription volume, specialty medications accounted for 45.4 percent of pharmacy revenue in 2018, which equates to $218.6 billion.[ref](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2018-and-outlook-to-2023 \"Medicine Use and Spending in the U.S., A Review of 2018 and Outlook to 2023, IQIVIA Institute, 2019\"),[ref](https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2019/9/specialty-drug-spend-soars-can-formulary-management-bring-it-down-earth \"Specialty Drug Spend Soars. Can Formulary Management Bring It Down to Earth?, Managed Care Magazine, 2019\") Such statistics underline the significant cost of specialty medications, which often face little to no brand name or generic (biosimilar in the case of biologics) competition.[ref](https://cvshealth.com/thought-leadership/whats-special-about-specialty \"What’s Special About Specialty, CVS Health\") \n\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), any Part D drug with a wholesale acquisition cost over $670 per month (over $8,040 per year) is eligible for specialty tier placement.[ref](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Downloads/Announcement2018.pdf \"Announcement of Calendar Year (CY) 2018 Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Medicare Advantage and Part D Payment Policies and Final Call Letter and Request for Information, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2017\") However, this CMS recommendation may represent the low-end of cost for specialty medications. \n\nA recent study calculated the average annual cost of 61 prevalent specialty medications for chronic conditions at $78,871.[ref](https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2019/06/trends-in-retail-prices-of-specialty-prescription-drugs-year-end-update.doi.10.26419-2Fppi.00073.001.pdf \"Trends in Retail Prices of Specialty Prescription Drugs Widely Used by Older Americans: 2017 Year-End Update, AARP Public Policy Institute, 2019\") This number is about 10-fold higher than the annual CMS threshold and about three-fold higher than the average annual cost for the same specialty medications in 2006.[ref](https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2019/06/trends-in-retail-prices-of-specialty-prescription-drugs-year-end-update.doi.10.26419-2Fppi.00073.001.pdf \"Trends in Retail Prices of Specialty Prescription Drugs Widely Used by Older Americans: 2017 Year-End Update, AARP Public Policy Institute, 2019\") As a general observation, cost typically scales with complexity for specialty medications. \n\n## Reimbursement\n\nGiven their range of complexity and expense, reimbursement processes can vary significantly among specialty medications. For example, about half of specialty medications are covered under the pharmacy benefit of patients’ health plans while the rest are covered under the medical benefit.[ref](https://payorsolutions.cvshealth.com/insights/managing-specialty-drug-spend-under-the-medical-benefit \"Managing Specialty Drug Spend Under the Medical Benefit, Innovations and Automation for More Effective Management, CVS Health Payor Solutions, 2017\") \n\nThis coverage decision is often based on where the medication is dispensed. If medications are administered at a hospital, provider office or outpatient facility, the medical benefit is typically used, whereas the pharmacy benefit is used for medications administered at home.[ref](http://www.insideedgeconsulting.com/views-news/pharmacy-benefit-vs-medical-benefit/ \"Pharmacy benefit vs. medical benefit, Inside Edge Consulting, 2015\") \n\nThis variability can impact how easily patients are able to access their medications. In fact, absence of real-time claims adjudication and traditional formulary process on the medical benefit influences how payers manage new specialty medications, with 100 percent of payers installing medical PA requirements within three months of drug launch.[ref](https://www1.magellanrx.com/documents/2019/03/medical-pharmacy-trend-report_2018.pdf/ \"Medical Pharmacy Trend Report, Magellan Rx Management, 2018\") \n\nWhile technology like electronic prior authorization (ePA) is often available for pharmacy benefit claims, it is less common for medical benefit claims, which can lead to care delays for patients. \n\nThe unique features of specialty medications can strain the healthcare ecosystem and keep patients from receiving needed care. In response, new strategies and industry participants have emerged within healthcare to overcome challenges created by these complex therapies. \n","metaName":"Features Block 1"}]},{"contentType":"blockReportSection","sectionId":"4iF6eDBnTr51dsNXFYdDhc","sectionTitle":"Expanding Healthcare Ecosystem for Specialty Medications","sectionShortTitle":"Expanding Healthcare Ecosystem","sectionIntro":"The complexity and challenges of specialty medications has created opportunities for growth and change within healthcare.

Product can spoil if temperature is not properly maintained, becoming ineffective or even unsafe for patient use. \n\nAs a result, manufacturers can require cold-chain distribution to ensure that medications are properly handled and reach patients immediately before administration.[ref](https://www.mckesson.com/documents/manufacturers/commercializing-gene-therapies-and-orphan-drugs/ \"The Key to Commercializing Revolutionary Gene Therapies and Other Orphan Drugs: High-Touch Services that Enhance Patient Outcomes, McKesson\") Manufacturers use LDNs to maintain this level of control over product logistics – limiting waste, guaranteeing quality and confirming safety.[ref](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/the-ins-and-outs-of-specialty-pharmacy \"The Ins and Outs of Specialty Pharmacy, Pharmacy Times, 2018\") \n\nFor those specialty therapies requiring provider administration, distribution and reimbursement can be unique. In many cases, provider offices purchase medications, take responsibility for their storage, later administer them to patients and seek reimbursement in a process termed buy-and-bill.[ref](https://drugchannelsinstitute.com/products/industry_report/wholesale/ \"The 2019-20 Economic Report on Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and Specialty Distributors, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") \n\nAlternatively, provider offices can receive specialty medications from a pharmacy for short-term storage and on-demand administration to patients in a process termed white bagging. A third option, termed brown bagging, involves dispense of specialty therapies directly to patients who then bring the medications to a designated site-of-care for administration. \n\nThe preferred method varies by network stakeholder, with each option delivering distinct economics and value. For example, payers may prefer brown bagging as they can directly negotiate medication prices with the manufacturer, guide patients to cheaper sites-of-care for administration and process more claims through the pharmacy benefit where utilization management is simpler. As a result, use of the buy-and-bill model for distribution and reimbursement has decreased while white and brown bagging has increased by 11 percent from 2010 to 2016.[ref](https://drugchannelsinstitute.com/products/industry_report/wholesale/ \"The 2019-20 Economic Report on Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and Specialty Distributors, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") \n\n## Specialty Pharmacies\n\nMany retail pharmacies do not keep specialty medications in stock and/or are unable to help patients through associated reimbursement paperwork. Some may even require payment upfront, which is not feasible for many patients.[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706163/pdf/bth05_2p050.pdf \"The Evolution of Specialty Pharmacy, Biotechnology Healthcare, 2008\") \n\nSpecialty pharmacies evolved as a solution for complex medications that require high-touch services for distribution, reimbursement and patient management. As specialty medications have grown in number and utilization, so have specialty pharmacies. In fact, the number of accredited specialty pharmacies reached 911 in 2018 – a 139 percent increase from 2015.[ref](https://www.drugtopics.com/article/specialty-pharmacies-rise \"Specialty Pharmacies on the Rise, Drug Topics – Voice of the Pharmacist, 2019\") ","metaName":"Ecosystem Block 1"},{"contentType":"blockQuote","metaName":"QUOTE - Accredited SPs","alignment":"right","quoteText":"The number of accredited specialty pharmacies *increased 139% from 2015 - 2018.[ref](https://www.drugtopics.com/article/specialty-pharmacies-rise \"Specialty Pharmacies on the Rise, Drug Topics – Voice of the Pharmacist, 2019\")*"},{"contentType":"blockText","text":"Specialty pharmacies often seek accreditation from independent organizations to showcase their capabilities and ability to deliver value-based care, which can be important for gaining inclusion into manufacturer LDNs and payer networks to secure reimbursement.[ref](https://www.journalofclinicalpathways.com/article/accreditation-explosion-among-top-specialty-pharmacy-trends \"Accreditation Explosion Among Top Specialty Pharmacy Trends, Journal of Clinical Pathways, 2018\") \n\nThere are three primary types of specialty pharmacies, including independent, PBM-owned and provider-owned. PBM-owned specialty pharmacies are largest by market share, accounting for over 70 percent of prescription revenues from specialty medications.[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/04/the-top-15-specialty-pharmacies-of-2018.html \"The Top 15 Specialty Pharmacies of 2018: PBMs Keep Winning, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") By controlling dispense of specialty medications, PBMs can direct members to preferred specialty pharmacies, implement utilization management strategies more effectively and share in government-sponsored 340B discounts by acting as contract pharmacies to providers, hospitals and other covered entities.[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/08/heres-how-pbms-and-specialty-pharmacies.html \"Here’s How PBMs and Specialty Pharmacies Snag Super-Size Profits from the 340B Program, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\"),[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/08/as-hospitals-pursue-specialty-pharmacy.html \"As Hospitals Pursue Specialty Pharmacy (and Walgreens Bets More on 340B), PBMs Become Their Best Frenemies, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\")\n\nIndependent specialty pharmacies have lost market share in recent years as a result of these PBM-owned specialty pharmacies narrowing payer networks.[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/04/the-top-15-specialty-pharmacies-of-2018.html \"The Top 15 Specialty Pharmacies of 2018: PBMs Keep Winning, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\"),[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/05/the-state-of-specialty-pharmacy-2019.html \"The State of Specialty Pharmacy 2019: Industry Trends and Photos from #Asembia19, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") To gain network access and remain competitive, independent specialty pharmacies must offer superior business capabilities and services to all stakeholders.[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/05/the-state-of-specialty-pharmacy-2019.html \"The State of Specialty Pharmacy 2019: Industry Trends and Photos from #Asembia19, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") \n\nProvider-owned specialty pharmacies have grown significantly over the last few years to deliver higher-quality care to patients prescribed complex medications as well as to benefit from 340B drug-pricing discounts. From 2016 to 2018, the number of large hospitals (600 beds or more) with a specialty pharmacy increased by 29 percent (from 47 percent to 76 percent).[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/08/heres-how-pbms-and-specialty-pharmacies.html \"Here’s How PBMs and Specialty Pharmacies Snag Super-Size Profits from the 340B Program, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") For patient-administered specialty medications covered under the pharmacy benefit, provider-owned specialty pharmacies must also gain inclusion into payer networks for patients to fill prescriptions at these locations.[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/08/heres-how-pbms-and-specialty-pharmacies.html \"Here’s How PBMs and Specialty Pharmacies Snag Super-Size Profits from the 340B Program, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\") \n\n## Hub programs for patient support\n\nClinical and reimbursement complexity of specialty medications create healthcare challenges that can be difficult for individual network participants to overcome on their own. For patients, this can mean delay in time to therapy and medication non-adherence. Hub programs sit at the center of the healthcare ecosystem and coordinate with key network stakeholders to help patients access, afford and adhere to specialty medications.[ref](https://pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/special-report/finding-the-hub-in-specialty-pharma-services/ \"Finding the ‘HUB’ in Specialty Pharma Services, Pharmaceutical Commerce, 2013\"),[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/03/delivering-enhanced-patient-and.html \"Delivering an Enhanced Patient and Prescriber Experience for Personalized Therapies, Drug Channels Institute, 2019\"),[ref](http://pharmacytoday.org/article/S1042-0991(16)31650-4/pdf \"Continuing evolution of hub services, Pharmacy Today, 2017\"),[ref](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/hub-services-simplifying-specialty-pharmacy \"(Hub services: Simplifying Specialty Pharmacy, Pharmacy Times, 2018\")","metaName":"Ecosystem Block 2"},{"contentType":"blockPicture","metaTitle":"Hub Services Graphic","alt":"Graphic depicting the hub and spoke model for patient support services (PSP).

As more patients are enrolled into traditional hubs, more full-time employees (FTEs) are needed to cover the extra work which can increase program costs significantly.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/a-change-of-pace-for-accessing-specialty-medications/ \"A Change of Pace for Accessing Specialty Medications, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") As a result of these inefficiencies, 83 percent of manufacturers of specialty medications expressed that there is room for improvement in the current hub model.[ref](https://academynet.com/sites/default/files/csi2019spreport.pdf \"2019 State of Specialty Pharmacy Report: Tracking the Future of Specialty Pharmacy, CSI Specialty Group, 2019\") \n\nOutdated communication via phone calls and faxes can also contribute to slow completion progress and delay in time to therapy for patients. As hub programs are most impactful within two to three years of specialty product launches, incentive to automate manual processes and standardize workflows within the traditional hub model has been limited.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/a-change-of-pace-for-accessing-specialty-medications/ \"A Change of Pace for Accessing Specialty Medications, CoverMyMeds, 2019\")\n\n## Electronic Patient Support Services\n\nThrough advances in healthcare IT, many steps in the specialty workflow have the potential for automation. By making manual steps the exceptions within a primarily electronic workflow, more patients can experience support and accelerated time to therapy. \n\nTechnology enables a scalable model for patient support services that addresses complexity across the full spectrum of specialty medications while allowing for customization to fit the individual needs of specific products. Such changes have already contributed to a 27 percent reduction in time to therapy during a preliminary study.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/ms-patient-access-white-paper/ \"Revolutionizing Patient Access and Support for Specialty Therapies: Multiple Sclerosis, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") \n\n## Enrollment\n\nWhile it is estimated that less than 10 percent of patient enrollment into support services is completed electronically,[ref](https://pocp.com/wp-content/uploads/PDF/6-%20NCPDP_2015_ED_Summit_SpecialtyRx.pdf \"Automating Specialty Pharmacy: Identifying Gaps, NCPDP, 2015\") new technology can automate patient enrollment at the point of prescribing so that potentially all patients have the opportunity for support. \n\nThis method uses the ePrescription itself to trigger enrollment into support services when the provider prescribes to a program-operated non-dispensing pharmacy. By capturing the prescription earlier during the patient journey, care coordination activities can be completed sooner to help improve time to therapy. \n\n## Reimbursement Activities\n\nOther steps within the specialty workflow also lend themselves to automation, including, BI, BV, PA and scheduling any needed lab work for patients. Platforms for completing BI/BV and PA electronically already exist and have been integrated into electronic patient support services for specialty medications. \n\nSuch technology will allow for automatic determinations based on preset payer-defined criteria. The opportunity for real-time responses can accelerate stakeholder decision-making to limit unnecessary treatment delays for patients. While industry standards are still under development,[ref](https://www.drugchannels.net/2018/12/three-reasons-to-join-industry-wide.html \"Three Reasons to Join the Industry-Wide Effort to Speed Time-to-Therapy for Specialty Pharmacy, Drug Channels Institute, 2018\") flexible and customizable technology is important for accommodating diverse stakeholder workflows. \n\n## Visibility\n\nA centralized platform, accessible to all relevant healthcare stakeholders within the specialty workflow, creates visibility for completing outstanding tasks and driving efficient care coordination. Such a complete, longitudinal view of patient cases can limit unnecessary phone calls among stakeholders and patients as progress is tracked virtually in real time.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/amp-access-for-more-patients-tm-improves-time-to-therapy-for-specialty/ \"End-To-End Electronic Support Improves Patient Access for Specialty Medications, CoverMyMeds, 2019\") \n\nGiving patients insight into the status of their specialty prescriptions through online or mobile resources can also help to promote efficient care while reducing uncertainty and avoidable phone calls to healthcare stakeholders. Empowering patients with visibility and transparency may be valuable for reducing prescription abandonment and medication non-adherence. \n\n## Network Connectivity\n\nAdoption of new, unfamiliar technology has traditionally been a difficult, time-consuming process within healthcare. However, by expanding on familiar technology with an existing user base, the barrier to viral stakeholder adoption of electronic patient support services is lowered.[ref](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/insights/articles/amp-access-for-more-patients-tm-improves-time-to-therapy-for-specialty/ \"End-To-End Electronic Support Improves Patient Access for Specialty Medications, CoverMyMeds, 2019\")  Awareness for the new technology is broadcast through an active healthcare network with established rapport and confidence in vendor capabilities.\n\n## Adherence Journey\n\nTech-enabled tools can help remind patients to take their medications or refill prescriptions. By leveraging text and email, care coordinators can remain in contact with patients through preferred communication channels and provide assistance when needed. Such technology facilitates open dialogue with patients that can be important for improving adherence to medications.[ref](https://pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/special-report/finding-the-hub-in-specialty-pharma-services/ \"Finding the ‘HUB’ in Specialty Pharma Services, Pharmaceutical Commerce, 2013\")\n","metaName":"Evolving Block 2"}]},{"contentType":"blockReportSection","sectionId":"6xPMyhL7qO8rYrSUCpHTei","sectionTitle":"Standardization for Specialty Medications","sectionShortTitle":"Standardization","sectionIntro":"Since 2018, the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) has been working to establish and refine industry standards for specialty medications.[ref](https://pocp.com/wp-content/uploads/PDF/6-%20NCPDP_2015_ED_Summit_SpecialtyRx.pdf \"Automating Specialty Pharmacy: Identifying Gaps, NCPDP, 2015\")","sectionBlocks":[{"contentType":"blockText","text":"NCPDP's Specialty Pharmacy Work Group 18 is comprised of healthcare experts across the industry and meets quarterly to align on major topics within the specialty drug space.
